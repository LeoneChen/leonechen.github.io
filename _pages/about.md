[简历（中文版）](https://365.kdocs.cn/l/cgbVMsdWuVmb)

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am doing research in the [Vul337](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/vul337) laboratory at Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Professor [Chao Zhang](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/people/chaoz/).

My main research is to use and design program analysis methods to analyze the security and robustness of trusted execution environments (such as SGX and SGX library operating systems) and their applications. At the same time, actively explore how trusted execution environments can be applied to privacy computing and confidential computing, hoping to make breakthroughs in privacy protection.
